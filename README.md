  <h1>Interactive LED Light System Based on Screen Color</h1>
  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>This project brings your entertainment experience to life by synchronizing LED light colors with the dominant colors of your screen. Using <strong>Bleak</strong> for Bluetooth connectivity and <strong>dxcam</strong> for screen capturing, this system minimizes latency to provide a seamless interactive lighting experience. Itâ€™s perfect for gaming, movie watching, or creating an immersive workspace.</p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Lighting</strong>: The LED lights change in real-time to match the colors on your screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Latency</strong>: Utilizes <strong>dxcam</strong> for screen capture, significantly reducing delay compared to alternatives like PIL.</li>
    <li><strong>Bluetooth Control</strong>: Connects to LED lights via Bluetooth using <strong>Bleak</strong>, enabling wireless operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Installation and Usage</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clone this repository:
      <pre><code>git clone &lt;repo-url&gt;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Install dependencies:
      <pre><code>pip install bleak dxcam</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Run the script:
      <pre><code>python interactive_led.py</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Variables to Customize</h3>
  <p>You can tweak the following variables in the script to optimize performance for your setup:</p>
  <pre><code>FPS = 144  # Frames per second for screen capture
DELAY = 0.04  # Delay between frame captures (in seconds)
RESIZE_SHAPE = [300, 250]  # Resolution for screen capture processing
DEVICE_ADDRESS = "BE:16:F7:00:03:B9"  # Replace with your LED device's Bluetooth address
CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = "0000fff3-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"  # Replace with your LED's UUID</code></pre>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to find your specific <code>DEVICE_ADDRESS</code> and <code>CHARACTERISTIC_UUID</code> for the LED light. A custom BLE exploration tool has been built to help with this.</p>
